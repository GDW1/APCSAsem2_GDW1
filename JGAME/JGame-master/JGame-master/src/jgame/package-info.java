/**
 * The JGame package contains everything related to the JGame game library. The atomic JGame object class is {@link jgame.GObject}, while the main class for Swing-targeted JGame applications is {@link jgame.Game}. JGame applications can run with (very) minimal modifications by using the {@link jgame.GameApplet} class as well. Under the hood, JGame uses Swing for painting, but novice developers don't need to worry about that: importing images from files or using simple painting operations are possible with the simplicity of the JGame elements, which are bridged with Swing in the {@link jgame.BaseGame} class.
