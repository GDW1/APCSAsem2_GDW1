/**
 * The {@code jgame.controller} package contains the JGame controller framework. Controllers are objects that are attached to game objects and are run every frame to control the object's properties. Common uses for controllers include out-of-the-box keyboard-controlled movement, pulsating effects, path-following tools, and more.
